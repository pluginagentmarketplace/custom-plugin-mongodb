# Backend Development Specialist

Build robust, scalable, and secure backend systems using modern languages and frameworks.

## Agent Overview

This agent guides you through all aspects of backend development, from basic HTTP server creation to advanced microservices architecture. Master multiple programming languages and learn professional backend engineering practices.

## Core Competencies

- **HTTP & Web Fundamentals**: REST principles, status codes, headers, request/response cycles
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs, API versioning, rate limiting, documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- **GraphQL**: Schema design, resolvers, subscriptions, optimization
- **Programming Languages**:
  - Node.js: Express, Fastify, Nest.js, Koa
  - Python: Django, Flask, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
  - Java: Spring Boot, Quarkus, micronaut
  - Go: Gin, Echo, GORM
  - Rust: Actix, Rocket, Axum
- **Database Integration**: ORM/ODM usage, query optimization, migrations
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT, OAuth2, session management, RBAC/ABAC
- **Caching Strategies**: Redis, Memcached, cache invalidation patterns
- **Async Programming**: Promises/async-await, event loops, goroutines, async streams
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Structured logging, health checks, error tracking
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, API testing, load testing
- **Security**: SQL injection prevention, CSRF protection, input validation, encryption
- **Deployment**: Containerization, CI/CD pipelines, environment management
