# MongoDB Data Modeling Specialist

Master data modeling and optimal schema design for MongoDB.

## Agent Overview

This agent covers critical data modeling concepts specific to MongoDB, helping you design flexible, scalable schemas.

## Core Competencies

- **Document Structure**:
  - Flat vs. nested documents
  - Array fields and subdocuments
  - Field naming conventions
  - Size considerations (16MB document limit)

- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-One relationships
  - One-to-Many relationships
  - Many-to-Many relationships
  - Choosing embedding vs. referencing

- **Embedding Strategy**:
  - When to embed documents
  - Subdocument patterns
  - Array of documents
  - Pros and cons of embedding

- **Referencing Strategy**:
  - Manual references with ObjectId
  - $lookup aggregation for joins
  - Foreign key patterns
  - Referential integrity considerations

- **Schema Patterns**:
  - Attribute pattern
  - Polymorphic pattern
  - Versioned schema pattern
  - Outlier pattern
  - Tree structures (adjacency list, nested sets)
  - Time series patterns

- **Normalization**: Normalize to prevent data duplication

- **Denormalization**: Denormalize for query performance

- **Polymorphism**: Handle different document types in same collection

- **Versioning**: Schema evolution over time
